    <h2>The image-stripping bug</h2>
    <p>The Medium publishing engine wraps PICTURE elements within a DIV within a FIGURE:</p>
    <figure>
      <p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="http://fakehost/test/photo.avif" type="image/avif"/>
          <source srcset="http://fakehost/test/photo.webp" type="image/webp"/>
          
        </picture>
      </p>
    </figure>
    <p>However, after this is processed with readability, the FIGURE element will be empty.</p>
    <p>Note that the IMG element does not have the &#34;src&#34; attribute. It seems that the src is populated by client-side JavaScript based on the information in SOURCE elements. Readability removes such IMG elements in &#34;unwrapNoscriptImages&#34;.</p>
    <p>Then, the DIV is converted to P by logic in code commented with &#34;Turn all divs that don&#39;t have children block level lements into p&#34;.</p>
    <p>Finally, because the new P is considered empty (it has no text nor images), it is removed by the &#34;Remove extra paragraphs&#34; logic.</p>
